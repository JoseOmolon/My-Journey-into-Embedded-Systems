## 🧭 Introduction

Hi, I'm Jose — a web developer now pivoting into **Embedded Systems** and **Electronics**.

While I started in web dev, I’ve always felt a deeper calling toward **building and programming real-world devices** the kind that beep, blink, and move.

### Why the shift?

- Web dev market is **oversaturated** and unstable for juniors
- AI is automating a lot of frontend grunt work
- Embedded offers a future-proof, hands-on career
- Passion: I want to build things I can touch
