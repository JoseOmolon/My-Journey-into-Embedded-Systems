## 🧭 Introduction

Hi, I'm Jose — a web developer now pivoting into **Embedded Systems** and **Electronics**.

While I started in web dev, I’ve always felt a deeper calling toward **building and programming real-world devices** the kind that beep, blink, and move.

### Why the shift?

- Web dev market is **oversaturated** and unstable for juniors
- AI is automating a lot of frontend grunt work
- Embedded offers a future-proof, hands-on career
- Passion: I want to build things I can touch

## 🚀 The Embedded Pivot

With IoT, drones, wearables, Smart Consumer Electronics and VR growing fast,  embedded systems sit at the heart of innovation. I’m documenting my learning path  as I transition from software to **software + hardware**.

This repo is my personal **learning blog**, tracking my journey from zero to pro — and maybe inspiring others along the way. This is will serve as a prototype to the "BLOG" Style website I will create to highlight this journey and also Serve as my Portfolio.
